I observed that the voltage always stays the same, but the current or amps relies on the voltage. For example, I built a circuit that had 100 ohms of resitance with a 10 volt battery going 
into a purple LED. It had 10 volts and around 80 amps of power. When I disconnected the wire from the volts and resistor, the volts stayed at 10, but the amps went down to zero because they rely
on the volts.
